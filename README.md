# About
Hiya, I'm Grey! I'm a software engineer dealing primarily in Discord bots, websites, and games.  
I'm trans/nonbinary and my preferred pronouns are he/him and they/them

I'm currently out of school, but in the past I've attended Mott Community College and Lawrence Technological University. I've also been part of a robotics team, specifically team 314 (The Megatron Oracles/Big MO), as both a student and mentor in training. I have also completed a computer hardware course and received both the CompTIA IT Fundamentals and A+ certifications

My main programming language is JavaScript (using Nodejs), but I've also used Python, C++, and Lua, and I'm very open to learning new ones! I use SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB for my own projects as well, and often create my own full stack applications (utilizing Expressjs, React, and more recently Svelte) from the ground up

# Projects

To date I've created a handful of fairly well-known bots, including:
- [Sheep](https://github.com/greys-bots/sheep)
- [Form Fox](https://github.com/greys-bots/form-fox)
- [Alex](https://github.com/greys-bots/alex)
- and [Ticket Golem](https://github.com/greys-bots/ticket-golem)!

I've also got some others, like Enderbot and Ocelot. Feel free to check out [this organization](https://github.com/greys-bots) for more info

On top of my own bots, I've also helped contribute to other ones by creating websites and offering code contributions! A good example is [PluralKit](https://pk.greysdawn.com). I've also contributed to the [bot](https://github.com/xSke/Pluralkit) along with another called [Tupperbox](https://github.com/Runi-c/Tupperbox) and am on the official dev team for the latter  
I've also got my own website where I post comics, flags, and other things [here](https://greysdawn.com)

Aside from bots, I've dabbled in game design and other small endeavors. I have a prototype DID-oriented notes app [here](https://github.com/greysdawn/syscomm) and a prototype game [here](https://github.com/greysdawn/anima-ptt)  
There's also a personal markdown site [here](https://github.com/greysdawn/md-bin) and a (no longer used) link shortener site [here](https://github.com/greysdawn/linkcutter)

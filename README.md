# Hi, I'm Grey
## I make stuff. A *lot* of stuff

I'm a software dev that loves tinkering with code, constantly jumping between the frontend and backend to make sure that everything looks good and works well. I'm constantly learning new things, and I often find myself going back to older code to write more efficient ways to handle the solutions I need

Anyways, here's some of that **stuff** I mentioned: 

## Bots
I'm especially known for the Discord bots I've made! You can find all of them on my [bots org](https://github.com/greys-bots), but here are some highlights: 

### Sheep ([repo](https://github.com/greys-bots/sheep))
A simple bot that allows users to change their name colors. Comes with lots of customization and utils, and has options for larger servers as well!

### Form Fox ([repo](https://github.com/greys-bots/form-fox))
A highly customizable and feature-packed forms/applications bot. Offers a multitude of question types, answer-based logic for adding roles to accepted users, and plenty more! 

### Ticket Golem ([repo](https://github.com/greys-bots/ticket-golem))
A straightforward ticketing bot. Also offers a fair amount of customization, with more to come soon!

## Sites
I also like to make websites- though, at the moment, a lot of my sites are outdated and are in need of some hefty makeovers. Here are a couple I'm willing to share right now: 

### Main website ([link](https://greysdawn.com))
Of course I had to make my own website ^^  
This one is closed-source at the moment, but will be released after some cleanup

### PluralKit Web ([repo](https://github.com/greys-sites/pluralkit-web))
Now defunct, but the code is still available to look through. If this is ever revived, will probably be redesigned and rewritten with Sveltekit

## Tools & Other Stuff
I don't just make bots and sites- I also like to work on libraries and various software tools

### PKAPI.js ([repo](https://github.com/greys-tools/pkapi.js))
A Typescript library for interacting with the PluralKit API

### PK RPC ([repo](https://github.com/greys-tools/pk-rpc))
A Rich Presence Client (RPC) that can display your current fronters on Discord. Cross-platform and works out of the box!

### Twitch Overlay ([repo](https://github.com/greys-tools/twitch-overlay))
A simple chat and alerts overlay setup for Twitch, built using JQuery and the server-sent events API

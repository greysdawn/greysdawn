# Hi, Call Us Grey!
## We make stuff-- a *lot* of stuff

We're a plural system that loves tinkering with code, always looking to learn and work on new things, and always going back to older code to write more efficient ways to handle the solutions we need. 
Programming is more than just a hobby for us: it's something we hope to be able to do for a living some day, and we're currently working towards the goal of being able to work full-time on our projects

Here's some of that stuffâ„¢ we mentioned:

## Bots
We're especially known for the Discord bots we've made! You can find all of them on our [bots org](https://github.com/greys-bots), but here are some highlights: 

### Sheep ([repo](https://github.com/greys-bots/sheep))
A simple bot that allows users to change their name colors. Comes with lots of customization and utils, and has options for larger servers as well!

### Form Fox ([repo](https://github.com/greys-bots/form-fox))
A highly customizable and feature-packed forms/applications bot. Offers a multitude of question types, answer-based logic for adding roles to accepted users, and plenty more! 

### Ticket Golem ([repo](https://github.com/greys-bots/ticket-golem))
A straightforward ticketing bot. Also offers a fair amount of customization, with more to come soon!

## Sites
We also like to make websites- though, at the moment, a lot of them are somewhat outdated and are in need of some hefty makeovers. Here are a couple we're willing to share right now: 

### Main website ([link](https://greysdawn.com)) | ([repo](https://github.com/greys-sites/website))
Of course, we just had to make our own website! This is our go-to spot for sharing our projects and any updates for them

### PluralKit Web ([repo](https://github.com/greys-sites/pluralkit-web))
A web interface for the PluralKit bot! Now defunct, but the code is still available to look through. If this is ever revived, will probably be redesigned and rewritten with Sveltekit

## Tools & Libraries
We don't just make bots and sites- we also like to work on libraries and various software tools :3

### PKAPI.js ([repo](https://github.com/greys-tools/pkapi.js))
A Typescript library for interacting with the PluralKit API

### PK RPC ([repo](https://github.com/greys-tools/pk-rpc))
A Rich Presence Client (RPC) that can display your current fronters on Discord. Cross-platform and works out of the box!

### Twitch Overlay ([repo](https://github.com/greys-tools/twitch-overlay))
A simple chat and alerts overlay setup for Twitch, built using JQuery and the server-sent events API
